### Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). According to the [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), create-react-app is one of the officially supported ways to create single-page applications in React.

### Prerequisites
To have a local copy of this project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following 
software/libraries/plugins

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Download and install Node, which also includes NPM(Node Package Manager). Alternative to Node + NPM is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Download and install VS Code or any Editor/IDE(Integrated Development Environment) of your choice. - Optional

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software/libraries/plugins.

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running. Let's use Node + NPM for this project.
* Head to the official Node website to download and install Node, which also includes NPM.
* Select the "Recommended For Most Users" button and download the current version for your Operating System.
* After you download and install Node, open command prompt/terminal and run the following commands to check if everything works:
    * node -v
    * npm -v
* To run the application, change to the directory where the app was installed using "cd <folder_name>".
* Run "npm install" to install all the dependencies used by the app.
* Finally, run "npm start" to see the app live on the localhost.

### Available Scripts
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
